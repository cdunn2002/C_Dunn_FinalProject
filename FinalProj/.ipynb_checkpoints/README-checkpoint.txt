Comparing Phytoplankton Biomass with surface Nitrate and Oxygen levels off the coast of Oregon, March 2014 - May 2014
    In my final project I took data sets from profiling floats and moorings off the coast of Oregon through a 3 month period in 2014. My goal was to see the relationship between Nitrate and Oxygen during these particular months and it's effect on phytoplankton reproduction. I was curious if nitrogen levels would still be in excess amounts or if the sunlight and dissolved oxygen would off-put the balance slightly allowing for an increased growth in phytoplankton biomass.
